**Functionalities Brief Overview:** 
Includes the Profile Section, language change, and a fully operational Sign Up/Sign In section with a Lightning Address (not email address). 
Requirements:

**Profile Section:**
a. Implement user details, account info, and options for language change.

b. Allow users to log out from the Profile Section.

**Language Change:**

a. Enable users to change the app language.

b. Minimum supported languages: English, Spanish, and French.

c. Developers can add more languages as they see fit.

d. Changing the language should update all text in the web application when tested.


**Sign Up/Sign In Section:**

a. Create a fully functional Sign Up/Sign In section.
(no specific Lightning integration in part 1- just allow users to create accounts with Lightning addresses without verification)

**Figma Prototype Integration:**

a. Adhere to Figma designs for all functionalities.


**Security:**

a. Implement secure practices for authentication and data protection.

**PART 2: The Solution Web Mobile Application Open Source Project Competition Rules and Guidelines - Forgot Password Implementation**

**Prototype Link** https://themasnetwork.com/

**Mobile View Link:** https://www.figma.com/file/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design

**Desktop View Link:** https://www.figma.com/file/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=43-11637&mode=design&t=0oC9PkPNFbMHP9kg-4

**Objective:** 
Implement the Forgot Password functionality in the web application using **"Micro-Deposit Verification"** based on the provided Figma designs, where users can change passwords by verifying ownership of their Lightning address used to create the account.

**Link to the Value of "Micro-Deposit Verification" explanation** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EjIACQduGDZG3BalZuEI2ijt_fNxMQHw7PK9kNfuccU/edit?usp=sharing

**Requirements:**

All the Requirements from Part 1 plus the following below: 

**Forgot Password Functionality:**

a. Develop and integrate the Forgot Password functionality as directed by Figma.

b. Allow users to change passwords by verifying ownership of their Lightning address.

c. Use a non-Custodial lightning node setup for admins to verify user lightning addresses when sending the verification payments back to users, such as but not limited to Voltage Cloud, Umbrel, or Citadel, greenlight using core Lighning  (if you use this option it has to be compatible with lnd LN addresses).

(Participants are encouraged to seek for alternitave solutions to verify ownership of LN addresses rather than using this method suggested but should get feedback on their ideas from the competition's Discord channel or email sales@themasnetwork.com before implementation.)

Contact us on Discord or email sales@themasnetwork.com if you would like us to design the figma for your Lightning node integration.
