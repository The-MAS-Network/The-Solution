> ### Part 3: Enhanced User Management and Wallet Verification âš¡
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Objective:**

Develop a comprehensive web application that extends the functionalities from Parts 1 and 2, incorporating enhanced user management features, wallet verification mechanisms, and an admin control panel.

**User Requirements:**
- **Prototype Link:** ðŸŽ¨ [UI Design Files](https://www.figma.com/file/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=1-2116&mode=design&t=IEkbEFkfUBNl2p11-4)  
- **Mobile View Link:** ðŸŽ¨[Mobile View Link](https://the-solution-challenge.web.app/forgot-password) 
- **Desktop View Link:** ðŸŽ¨[Desktop View Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=43-11972&t=DGLI2iHWagSU0f63-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=43%3A11636&starting-point-node-id=43%3A11972&show-proto-sidebar=1)


**Lightning Address Verification:**
- During sign up, the application will verify if the username is an active Lightning Address. Non-active Lightning Addresses should not be allowed to sign up. 
*(example of non-active [LN Address](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZvfVuuY1mpB_ct7O8dDYe_SPzoy2vMWICGuI1TKhl58/edit?usp=sharing))*
- Implement a feature for users to verify their LN username in the settings (using the Lightning [Forgot Password Flow](https://the-solution-challenge.web.app/forgot-password) for the same process).
- Accounts of users who haven't verified their Lightning Address within 24 hours will be automatically deleted
- Unlock the Ordinal wallet setting on the home screen upon successful Lightning Address verification, as directed by the provided Figma designs. *(Check below Ordinal Wallet Verification for details of process)*
- Remove Earn Sats icon from the home screen for now as directed by the Figma **(Update)**
- Update Welcome Screen sign-up buttons 

**Ordinal Wallet Verification:**
- Implement a feature for users to verify ownership of their Ordinal Wallet on chain using 1 confirmation as directed by the provided Figma designs
- This verification should be available only after users have verified their Lightning Address as directed in Part 3
- After verification, users should be able to see the current Ordinals under the given wallet address, a refresh button to review the Ordinals under the given address again, and a disconnect wallet button

Develop streamlined admin controls for activating and managing collections, Delete account functionality, facilitating Lightning Address-based tipping within collections. Add the ability for users to access a dynamic leaderboard showcasing top earners weekly and all-time.

**Admin Section:**

**Activate Collection:**
- Activating collection and then allowing the admin to search for Lightning Addresses in a collection to see what Lightning Address owns what Ordinal form the collection
- When making a inactive collection active, then that collection moves from inactive to active
- Active collections can be made inactive by clicking on the three dots at the top right of the collection
- Active collections can not be edited until you make the collection inactive *(for clarity on collections, contact the Admins in the Discord)*

**Active Collection Tipping Functionality:**
- In active collections, the Admin should be able to tip all verified owners of the Ordinals in that collection via their Lightning Address.
- After searching a verified Lightning Address within one collection, the Admin should be able to tip Lightning Addresses individually as long as they own an Ordinal in that collection.
- When tipping a community, sats are evenly divided among users based on how many Ordinals they own from that collection and recorded in the history tab as per Figma.
- When tipping a user, sats are paid out via Lightning and recorded in the history tab as per Figma.
When tipping a community/individual, the ability to switch payment denomination between sats, BTC, and USD via Lightning is available

**Account Deletion:**

Users should be able to delete their account and a confirmation check to grant such access.
